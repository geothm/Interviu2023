# Interviu2023

The system consists of a University where Students can enroll in Classes. Some classes are only available to enroll
to students of a certain specialty. Some classes require that students who enroll are at least in a certain year
(ex: at least in year 3 to enroll in Class). All classes have a maximum number of participants.

TODO
1. Refactor code according to good software design principles, useful data structures, extensibility etc
2. Add a feature to list all classes in the University curriculum 
3. Add a feature to make only some classes available for enrollment (the curriculum still shows them, but they
are currently unavailable for enrollment)
